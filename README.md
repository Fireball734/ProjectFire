## CONTROLS

Left Arrow - Run left

## Plans V2:
1. Find a game engine good for platformers: GODOT
2. Write down ideas for gameplay & abilities
### Game Ideas:

**Core Mechanic** - Power of Fire

**Fuel Mechanic**: Fireball has a set amount of "fuel" that slowly replenishes over time, and is used up when he uses any fire-based moves.


#### Platforming Mechanics:

**Movement**-

Walk

Run (Maybe have one movement speed account for walking & running)

Jump

Double-jump(?) (consider it, but not very likely)

Tackle/dash (like Wario's shoulder tackle)

mid-air dash (affected by gravity, maybe weaker than grounded tackle)

**Attacks**:

fireball (bounces on ground, weak)

fire blast (short-ranged, strong)

shot (long-ranged, piercing, only 6 a time before needs to reload [takes a long time])

ember (floats in air, slow, very weak)
